## Why Diamonds:

Extreme hardness, unrivalled brilliance, and high emotive worth are all attributes of diamonds. The only other mineral that can scratch a diamond's surface is another diamond because they are comprised almost entirely of carbon atoms.

Diamond is also known to be the hardest known natural material on both the Vickers scale and the Mohs scale.

There are the 4C's of Diamond, which are:
> ðŸ’¡ Diamond Cut
> 
> ðŸ’¡ Diamond Color
> 
> ðŸ’¡ Diamond Clarity
> 
> ðŸ’¡ Diamond Carat

## Objective:

Studies have shown that diamond is said to be composed of **pure carbon**. Diamond is also known to be a naturally occuring substance and the most popular **gemstone**.

The high cost of marketing, the scarcity of fine quality stones, and the high demand for diamonds all contribute to their high price. It's just a matter of supply and demand.

The objective of this project is to analyze and understand patterns, trends, and relationships between various diamond attributes and prices. This information can be used to inform business decisions in the diamond industry, such as pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, and inventory management.

## Problem Statement:

The problem statement of this analysis is to identify the following:

 ðŸ’¡ Which factors have the greatest impact on the price of a diamond, and how can this information be used to inform pricing strategies in the diamond industry?
> 
 ðŸ’¡ How do different diamond characteristics, such as cut quality and color, affect customer preferences and purchase decisions?
> 
 ðŸ’¡ If there a relationship between the carat weight of a diamond and its price, and if so, how strong is this relationship?

Overall the main goal is to gain insight and understand the prices and values of Diamonds.

## Use Case:

This research can be used for analysis and machine learning purposes, such as developing models to predict diamond prices or identifying factors that influence the value of a diamond. It can also be used to find patterns and trends in diamond qualities and pricing using exploratory data analysis. The dataset can also be used to inform business choices in the diamond sector, including pricing tactics, inventory control, and advertising campaigns.
