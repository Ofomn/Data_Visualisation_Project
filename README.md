## Why Diamonds:

Extreme hardness, unrivalled brilliance, and high emotive worth are all attributes of diamonds. The only other mineral that can scratch a diamond's surface is another diamond because they are comprised almost entirely of carbon atoms.

Diamond is also known to be the hardest known natural material on both the Vickers scale and the Mohs scale.

There are the 4C's of Diamond, which are:
> ðŸ’¡ Diamond Cut
> ðŸ’¡ Diamond Color
> ðŸ’¡ Diamond Clarity
> ðŸ’¡ Diamond Carat
